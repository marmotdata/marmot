The DBT plugin ingests metadata from dbt (Data Build Tool) projects, including models, sources, seeds, and lineage relationships. It reads dbt's generated artifacts to understand your data transformation layer and how it connects to your warehouse.

## Prerequisites

### Generate dbt Artifacts

Before Marmot can ingest your dbt project, you need to generate the artifact files. These are created in your project's `target/` directory.

**Required:** Run `dbt compile` or `dbt build` to generate `manifest.json`:

```bash
dbt compile
# or
dbt build
```

**Recommended:** Run `dbt docs generate` to create `catalog.json` with column types and statistics:

```bash
dbt docs generate
```

### Artifact Files

| File            | Required | Generated By                          | Contains                              |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `manifest.json` | Yes      | `dbt compile`, `dbt build`, `dbt run` | Models, sources, seeds, lineage, SQL  |
| `catalog.json`  | No       | `dbt docs generate`                   | Column types, table stats, owner info |
