# Glossary

The Glossary lets you define business terms and create a shared vocabulary across your organisation. Instead of different teams using different names for the same concept, the glossary establishes standard terminology that everyone can reference.

## Creating Terms

Navigate to **Glossary** in the header and click **Create Term**. Give your term a name and description explaining what it means and how it should be used.

## Associating Terms with Assets

Glossary terms become useful when linked to data assets. To associate a term with an asset:

1. Navigate to the asset page
2. Find **Glossary Terms** in the sidebar
3. Click **Add** and search for the term
4. Select the term to link it
