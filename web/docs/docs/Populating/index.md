# Populating

There are many ways of populating Marmot with assets and lineage. You can use all of the methods, or just one, it's entirely up to you and what works best with your existing pipelines and workflows.

---

## CLI

The CLI is the easiest way to get started with Marmot, it provides a simple YAML configuration for fetching asset from various data sources. The supported plugins for the CLI is constantly being updated.

## Terraform

If you're looking for a more powerful option, or, want to integrate with your existing IaC pipelines, you can use the Marmot Terraform provider.

## Pulumi

You can also utilise the Terraform provider with Pulumi to build your IaC with your favourite programming language.

## API

The API can be used for custom integrations with your existing tooling or software. You can find the [API documentation here](/api).
