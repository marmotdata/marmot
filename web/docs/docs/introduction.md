# Introduction

Marmot is an open-source data catalog designed for teams who want powerful data discovery without enterprise complexity. Built with a focus on simplicity and speed, Marmot helps you catalog assets across your entire data stack - from databases and APIs to message queues and data pipelines.

## Why Marmot?

Unlike traditional catalogs that require extensive infrastructure and configuration, Marmot ships as a **single binary** with an intuitive UI, making it easy to deploy and start cataloging in minutes.

### Built for Modern Data Teams

- **Deploy in Minutes**: Single binary, Docker, or Kubernetes - no complex setup required
- **Powerful Search**: Query language with full-text, metadata, and boolean operators
- **Track Lineage**: Interactive dependency graphs to understand data flows and impact
- **Flexible Integrations**: CLI, REST API, Terraform, and Pulumi - catalog assets your way
- **Lightweight**: PostgreSQL-backed with minimal resource requirements

## Key Capabilities

### Search Everything

Find any data asset across your entire organisation in seconds. Combine full-text search with structured queries using metadata filters, boolean logic, and comparison operators.

### Interactive Lineage Visualisation

Trace data flows from source to destination with interactive dependency graphs. Understand upstream and downstream dependencies, identify bottlenecks, and analyse impact before making changes.

### Metadata-First Architecture

Store rich metadata for any asset type. From tables and topics to APIs and dashboards - if it matters to your data stack, you can catalog it in Marmot.

### Team Collaboration

Assign ownership, document business context, and create glossaries. Keep your entire team aligned with centralised knowledge about your data assets.
