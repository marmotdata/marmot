Marmot is an open-source data catalog that helps teams discover, understand, and govern their data assets. It's designed for modern data ecosystems where data flows through multiple systems, formats, and teams.

Marmot was designed with the following in mind:

- **Simplicity**: Single binary deployment
- **Performance**: Fast search and efficient processing
- **Extensibility**: Document almost anything with the flexible API

## ‚ú® Features:

- **Find anything fast with flexible queries**: Boolean, text, metadata, and comparison operators for powerful search capabilities
- **Connect through multiple interfaces:** CLI, API, Terraform, and Pulumi integrations for seamless workflow integration
- **Visualize data flows with interactive graphs:** Track dependencies and analyze impact through comprehensive lineage visualization
- **Documentation and governance:** Markdown documentation support with tagging and classification capabilities

## üîåSupported Data Sources

Marmot supports ingesting assets through its CLI, API as well as Terraform and Pulumi integrations for Infrastructure-as-code. Marmot's ecosystem of plugins for ingestion through the CLI is constantly growing with current support for Kafka, AsyncAPI, PostgresSQL, SQS, SNS, Iceberg and many more. However, you can ingest almost any asset you want through the flexible API and IaC providers.
