Marmot is an open-source data catalog that helps teams discover, understand, and govern their data assets. It's designed for modern data ecosystems where data flows through multiple systems, formats, and teams.

Marmot was designed with the following in mind:

- **Simplicity**: Easy to use UI, single binary deployment
- **Performance**: Fast search and efficient processing
- **Extensibility**: Document almost anything with the flexible API

## ‚ú® Features:

- **Find anything fast with flexible queries**: Boolean, text, metadata, and comparison operators for powerful search capabilities
- **Populate assets with your preferred technology:** CLI, API, Terraform, and Pulumi integrations
- **Visualize data flows with interactive graphs:** Track dependencies and analyze impact through comprehensive lineage visualization
- **Documentation and governance:** Markdown documentation support with tagging and classification capabilities

## üîåSupported Data Sources

Marmot offers multiple ways to ingest assets: through its CLI, API, or infrastructure-as-code solutions like Terraform and Pulumi. The CLI features a growing ecosystem of plugins with current support for Kafka, AsyncAPI, PostgreSQL, SQS, SNS, and many others. For assets not covered by existing plugins, Marmot's flexible API and infrastructure-as-code providers enable ingestion of virtually any asset type you need.
