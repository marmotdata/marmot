The Glue plugin discovers and catalogs AWS Glue resources including jobs, databases, tables and crawlers. It captures metadata such as job configurations, table schemas, crawler schedules and database properties. Iceberg-managed tables are automatically skipped (use the dedicated Iceberg plugin instead).

## AWS Configuration

See [AWS Configuration](./Shared%20Configuration/AWS%20Configuration.md) for the supported AWS configuration options.

## Keyless authentication

On Marmot Cloud or Marmot Enterprise the pipeline can present its own identity instead of access keys. Register your Marmot instance as an IAM OIDC identity provider (client id `sts.amazonaws.com`), create a role whose trust policy allows `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` for that provider with `<issuer host>:sub` equal to the pipeline's subject, `pipeline:<name>` as reported by the pipeline API, and set `credentials.role_arn` and `credentials.region`. No key exists anywhere; Marmot mints a short-lived token for each run.
